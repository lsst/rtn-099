Here we provide photometric transformation relations between the LSST Commissioning Camera data in the Data Preview 1 data set and other well-known optical/NIR photometric systems (Dark Energy Survey, PanSTARRS-1, Euclid, etc.)

{\bf From Meagan's Thesis:}
Astronomical survey systems are used around the world to collect data from the surrounding cosmic neighborhood and beyond. Different optical filters are used to collect different kinds of data, and each survey system uses its own filters specified for its mission. The transformation equations provided in this thesis help to begin bridging the gaps between filter systems, allowing more data to be used overall.
